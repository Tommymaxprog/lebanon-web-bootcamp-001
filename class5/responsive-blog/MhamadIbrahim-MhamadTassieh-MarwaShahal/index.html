        <p class="context">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
          been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
          and scrambled it to make a type specimen
          book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
          essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
          Ipsum passages, and
          more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
